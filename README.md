Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes Pioneer Kochi, a coaching center in Kerala, India, facing post-COVID challenges in student enrollment and lead conversion. The goal was to identify operational inefficiencies, improve the 20% enrollment rate, and recommend data-driven solutions for sustainable growth.

Key Objectives

Optimize marketing strategies and lead management.

Propose cost-effective solutions to boost enrollment.

Data Sources & Methodology
Data Collection
Enquiry Data: Manual Excel sheets tracking student leads (1,005 entries).

Payment Records: Fee transactions reconciled with enrollment data.

Course & Batch Details: Structured information on offerings, schedules, and costs.

Location Data: Geographic distribution of leads (Kochi-centric).

Tools & Techniques
Power BI: Dashboards for visualizing enrollment trends, revenue, and marketing channel efficacy.

Data Cleaning: Corrected inconsistencies in dates, categories, and missing values.

SWOT Analysis: Evaluated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Key Findings
1. Low Conversion Rate (20%)
80% of leads dropped due to inconsistent follow-ups and lack of CRM.

Top Reasons: Unresponsive leads (no callback), lack of interest, or poor lead quality.

2. Marketing Insights
Best Channels: Internet (parent company’s website) and local newspaper (Thozhil Vartha).

Weaknesses: Minimal social media presence (Instagram/Facebook) and no dedicated website.

3. Revenue Leakage
Non-payment Issues: 15% revenue loss from unpaid fees (e.g., SSCJE batch lost ₹151K).

Course Performance: RRB ALP generated the highest revenue; BTech Tuition had zero enrollment.

4. Geographic Focus
90% of leads came from Kochi and nearby areas, highlighting the need for localized marketing.
